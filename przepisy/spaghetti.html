        <p> <strong> Spaghetti bolognese </strong> spaghetti alla bolognese in Italian, pronounced: “spa-GET-tie alla bolo-NYEH-seh) is a main course consisting of spaghetti (long thin strings of pasta) with a bolognese sauce over it.<br><br>
            
            It is a corrupted version of the traditional ragù alla Bolognese: pasta with a meat sauce as they make it in the city of Bologna. But calling spaghetti bolognese an Italian dish would be a step too far, and many Italians would be disappointed with the description. <br><br>
            
            This is because, in Italy, there are many types of ragù, including the one from Bologna. Bolognese sauce should only ever be served with fresh tagliatelle, tortellini or lasagne; never with spaghetti as the sauce is thick and contains pieces, so will not satisfactorily cling to thin, delicate strings. A firmer pasta is needed as, according to the average Italian, a firm sauce needs firm pasta it' s as simple as that.<br><br>
            
            As an example of the passion Italians reserve for their cuisine and all of its regional varieties, a lively discussion arose in 2016 after The New York Times gave a recipe for “white bolognese”. A bolognese sauce without tomatoes? “Unthinkable” was the clear message from the readers. But no matter your feelings about tradition and ingredients, spaghetti bolognese is one of the most widely eaten and beloved dishes. All over the world, it is found on the menu of just about every Italian restaurant. <br><br></p>
