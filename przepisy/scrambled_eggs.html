      <p>What Are <strong>Scrambled Eggs?</strong> <em>Scrambled eggs</em> is a dish made from the whisked together yolks and whites of eggs, sometimes combined with butter, cream, or cheese, and cooked over low or medium heat (never high heat!) to achieve varying textures.</p>

        <li>2 tablespoons (30ml) of milk.</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of butter.</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper.</li>
      </ul>

      <ol>
        <li>Whisk eggs, salt and pepper in small bowl. Melt butter in non-stick skillet over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Pour in egg mixture and reduce heat to medium-low.</li>
